# Video Cropping API

This repository contains an API server built with Node.js and Express that allows you to crop videos from a YouTube URL. It utilizes the `ytdl-core` library to download YouTube videos, and the `ffmpeg` command-line tool to perform the video cropping.

## Prerequisites

Before running the server, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Node.js
- FFmpeg

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/video-cropping-api.git
Install the dependencies:

shell
Copy code
cd video-cropping-api
npm install
Start the server:

shell
Copy code
npm start
The server will be running on http://localhost:3000.

Usage
The API exposes a single endpoint /crop-video that accepts the following query parameters:

- startTime (required): The start time of the desired video segment in the format hh:mm:ss.
- endTime (required): The end time of the desired video segment in the format hh:mm:ss.
- youtubeUrl (required): The URL of the YouTube video to be cropped.
Example usage:

   ```shell
   GET /crop-video?startTime=00:02:35&endTime=00:03:45&youtubeUrl=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=video-id
   This will download the YouTube video, crop the specified segment, and return the cropped video as a downloadable file.
